# Medical Image Analysis: Skin Cancer Detection with Deep Learning

This project focuses on **Medical Image Analysis** to detect skin cancer using deep learning. Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, and early detection is crucial for successful treatment. In this project, we use deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to classify skin lesions and predict the likelihood of cancer.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model to classify skin lesions from medical images. By analyzing dermoscopic images of skin, the model aims to differentiate between benign (non-cancerous) and malignant (cancerous) lesions. The project involves data preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation to assess the effectiveness of the model in diagnosing skin cancer.

## Objectives
- Preprocess a dataset of skin lesion images to make them suitable for model training.
- Build a CNN-based deep learning model to classify skin lesions.
- Train the model and evaluate its performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
- Visualize the modelâ€™s predictions and performance metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For programming the model and handling data.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the deep learning model (CNN).
- **Pandas/Numpy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and plotting the model's performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of labeled skin images, which are typically divided into several classes (e.g., benign, malignant). It may include images of common skin lesions such as melanomas, nevi, and keratoses.

If using a public dataset, you could use the **[ISIC Skin Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fanconic/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000)** from Kaggle or any other open-source dataset of dermoscopic skin images.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load and preprocess the images (resize, normalize, augment).
   - Apply data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling to improve model generalization.
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Model Building**:
   - Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using **Keras**.
   - The model will include convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for down-sampling, and fully connected layers for classification.

3. **Training**:
   - Train the model using the training dataset, applying backpropagation and gradient descent to optimize weights.
   - Use early stopping and validation data to prevent overfitting.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model on the test dataset using metrics such as:
     - **Accuracy**
     - **Precision**
     - **Recall**
     - **F1-score**
   - Visualize the results with confusion matrices and ROC curves.

5. **Model Predictions**:
   - Visualize the predictions made by the model on new skin images.
   - Analyze any misclassified images and discuss potential improvements to the model.
